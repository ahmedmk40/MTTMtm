# Case Management Module Documentation

## Overview

The Case Management module provides a comprehensive system for creating, tracking, and managing fraud investigation cases within the Transaction Monitoring and Fraud Detection System. It allows fraud analysts and compliance officers to investigate suspicious transactions, document their findings, and collaborate on case resolution.

## Key Features

- **Case Creation**: Create cases manually or automatically from flagged transactions
- **Transaction Linking**: Associate multiple transactions with a case for investigation
- **Case Notes**: Add and manage investigation notes
- **File Attachments**: Upload and manage supporting documents
- **Activity Tracking**: Automatically log all case-related activities
- **Case Assignment**: Assign cases to specific users for investigation
- **Status Management**: Track case progress through various status stages
- **Priority Levels**: Categorize cases by priority for efficient resource allocation
- **Resolution Tracking**: Document case outcomes and resolutions

2. **Open**: Initial investigation begins
3. **In Progress**: Active investigation with assigned investigator
4. **Pending Review**: Investigation complete, awaiting final review
5. **Closed**: Case resolved with appropriate resolution status

## Case Resolution Types

- **Confirmed Fraud**: Investigation confirms fraudulent activity
- **False Positive**: Investigation determines no fraud occurred
- **Inconclusive**: Unable to determine if fraud occurred
- **Legitimate**: Transaction confirmed as legitimate

## Integration Points

## API Endpoints

### Case Management
- `GET /api/cases/` - List all cases
- `POST /api/cases/` - Create a new case
- `GET /api/cases/{case_id}/` - Get case details
- `PUT /api/cases/{case_id}/` - Update case details
- `DELETE /api/cases/{case_id}/` - Delete a case

### Case Transactions
- `GET /api/cases/{case_id}/transactions/` - List case transactions
- `POST /api/cases/{case_id}/transactions/` - Add transaction to case
- `DELETE /api/cases/{case_id}/transactions/{transaction_id}/` - Remove transaction from case

### Case Notes
- `GET /api/cases/{case_id}/notes/` - List case notes
- `POST /api/cases/{case_id}/notes/` - Add note to case
- `DELETE /api/cases/{case_id}/notes/{note_id}/` - Delete note from case

### Case Attachments
- `GET /api/cases/{case_id}/attachments/` - List case attachments
- `POST /api/cases/{case_id}/attachments/` - Add attachment to case
- `DELETE /api/cases/{case_id}/attachments/{attachment_id}/` - Delete attachment from case

## Best Practices

1. **Consistent Documentation**: Maintain detailed notes for all investigation steps
2. **Timely Updates**: Update case status promptly as investigation progresses
3. **Evidence Preservation**: Attach all relevant documents and evidence to the case
4. **Clear Resolution**: Document clear reasoning for case resolution
5. **Regular Review**: Periodically review open cases to ensure progress

## Security Considerations

- All case data is subject to access controls based on user roles
- Case attachments are stored securely with appropriate encryption
- All case activities are logged for audit purposes
- Sensitive case information is redacted in exports and reports

## Performance Considerations

- Case list views use pagination to handle large numbers of cases
- Case attachments have size limits to prevent storage issues
- Long-running case queries are optimized with database indexes
- Case activity logging is performed asynchronously to maintain performance
