## Test Approach

### Test Methodology

1. **Preparation Phase**
   - Develop test cases based on business requirements
   - Set up test environment
   - Create test data
   - Train UAT participants

2. **Execution Phase**
   - Execute test cases
   - Record test results
   - Report defects
   - Track defect resolution

3. **Closure Phase**
   - Conduct regression testing
   - Prepare UAT report
   - Obtain sign-off from stakeholders

### Test Execution

1. Test cases will be executed manually by UAT participants
2. Each test case will be assigned to a specific tester based on their role
3. Testers will record test results and report defects
4. Defects will be prioritized and assigned to developers for resolution
5. Resolved defects will be retested

### Defect Management

1. Defects will be logged in the defect tracking system
2. Defects will be classified by severity and priority
3. Defects will be assigned to developers for resolution
4. Resolved defects will be verified by testers
