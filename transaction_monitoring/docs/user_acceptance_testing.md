## Introduction

User Acceptance Testing (UAT) is the final phase of testing before the system is deployed to production. The purpose of UAT is to verify that the system meets the business requirements and is ready for operational use.

UAT is performed by actual users of the system, not by developers or testers. This ensures that the system is tested from the perspective of those who will use it daily.

## UAT Process

The UAT process consists of the following steps:

1. **Preparation**: Set up the test environment, create test data, and prepare test cases.
2. **Training**: Train UAT participants on how to use the system and how to execute test cases.
3. **Execution**: UAT participants execute test cases and record results.
4. **Issue Reporting**: Report any issues or defects found during testing.
5. **Retesting**: After issues are fixed, retest to verify the fixes.
6. **Sign-off**: Once all critical issues are resolved, obtain formal sign-off from stakeholders.

## Test Environment Setup

### System Requirements

- Web browser: Chrome (latest version), Firefox (latest version), or Edge (latest version)
- Screen resolution: Minimum 1366x768
- Internet connection: Minimum 1 Mbps

### Test Data

The test environment should be populated with the following test data:

- Test users for each role (Compliance Officer, Fraud Analyst, Risk Manager, etc.)
- Sample transactions of various types (POS, E-commerce, Wallet)
- Sample fraud cases and AML alerts
- Sample rules and ML models

### Access Credentials

Test users will be provided with the following credentials:

| Role | Username | Password |
|------|----------|----------|
| Compliance Officer | compliance_officer | securepassword123 |
| Fraud Analyst | fraud_analyst | securepassword123 |
| Risk Manager | risk_manager | securepassword123 |
| System Administrator | system_admin | securepassword123 |
| Data Analyst | data_analyst | securepassword123 |
| Executive | executive | securepassword123 |
